tiny format
The 'tiny' format is minimalistic and logs basic details of the HTTP request.

It includes:
HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT)
Request URL
Status code of the response
Response length (size of the response in bytes)
Response time (in milliseconds)

sample output:

GET / 200 12ms
POST /login 404 8ms

GET / -> HTTP method is GET, the requested URL is /, the response status code is 200, and it took 12ms to respond.
POST /login -> HTTP method is POST, the requested URL is /login, the status code is 404 (not found), and the response time is 8ms.


dev format
The 'dev' format is more colorful and includes:

HTTP method
URL
Status code
Response time
Response length (size of the response in bytes)
It is easier to read and includes colors to visually differentiate various parts.

Sample Output:

+ 200ms : GET /index.html
: 404ms : POST /login

In this example:
GET /index.html: Green color for status 200 (successful request).
POST /login: Red color for status 404 (error).

dev format also includes some colors:

Green for successful responses (status 2xx)
Yellow for redirection responses (status 3xx)
Red for error responses (status 4xx and 5xx)



combined Format includes:

IP address of the client making the request
Request method (GET, POST, etc.)
Requested URL
HTTP version (e.g., HTTP/1.1)
Status code
Response size
Referrer (the page from which the request was made)
User-agent (the client's browser information)
Response time
This is ideal for production environments where detailed tracking and analytics are needed.

Sample Output:
::1 - - [10/Dec/2024:10:11:42 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 2326 "http://localhost:3000/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36" 12ms

In this example:
::1: The IP address of the client (in this case, local IP ::1 for localhost).
GET /index.html: The HTTP method GET and the requested URL /index.html.
HTTP/1.1: The HTTP version used.
200: The HTTP status code.
2326: The size of the response body (in bytes).
"http://localhost:3000/": The referrer URL (where the request originated from).
"Mozilla/5.0...": The user-agent string, identifying the client's browser and operating system.
12ms: The time taken to respond to the request.
